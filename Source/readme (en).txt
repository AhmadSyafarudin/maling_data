-------------------------------------------->>> Maling Data <<<-------------------------------------------------

Do you still remember?
when the virus tries to enter your computer silently, what happens to?
whether event of damage to Data in the format (*. exe, *. msi, *. jpg, *. doc, and his friends)! could be.
or? with such data way be taken over! and if it could be taken over means stealing! -\(O,o)
true, but forget the word steal and replace words take. :D

with the concept which the virus employ, I tried to create a tool with properties just like the virus.
This means the tool of evil, very evil yes or may be cursed!
forget the words if you want to try this tool! because?

--> There was no love to hide! If you do not want a taste of heart broken. <--
--> There is no science which should be hidden! If no word the information. <--

I just share information, rest, whatever you want to use it to do what. :D
This tool is free of charge because this tool is free (freeware).
